# Project: Digital Logic Design - Assignment 02

This project contains various digital logic design components implemented in Verilog, accompanied by testbenches to validate their functionalities. This work focuses on developing proficiency in using the SystemVerilog hardware description language and the ModelSim simulator software.

## Project Structure

- **Verilog Modules:**
  - `1.v`, `2.v`, `3.v`, `4.v`, `5.v`: Various Verilog modules implementing specific logic designs.

- **Testbenches:**
  - `TB1.v`, `TB2.v`, `TB3.v`, `TB4.v`: Testbenches for verifying the corresponding Verilog modules.

- **Documentation:**
  - `DLD-CA#02-REPORT.pdf`: A report detailing the design and implementation of the modules.

## Installation

To use the modules and run the testbenches, you will need a Verilog simulator such as ModelSim. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the Verilog files and testbenches.

3. Open your Verilog simulator and load the modules and their corresponding testbenches.

## Usage

Each module can be tested using its associated testbench file. The testbenches are designed to verify the functionality of each module. Simulate the testbenches using your Verilog simulator to check the outputs.
