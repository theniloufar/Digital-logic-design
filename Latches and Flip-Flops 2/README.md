# Project: Verilog and Quartus Logic Design Project

This project involves the design and implementation of various logic modules using Verilog and Quartus. It includes modules for specific logic operations, testbenches for verification, and Quartus project files for synthesis and simulation. The project demonstrates the use of Verilog for hardware description and Quartus for FPGA design.

## Project Structure

- **Verilog Modules:**
  - `a1.v`: Implements a specific logic or function.
  - `a1TB.v`: Verifies the functionality of the module in `a1.v`.
  - `aQ.v`: A Verilog module related to the Quartus project.
  - `counter5.v`: Implements a 5-bit counter.

- **Quartus Project Files:**
  - `aQ.qpf`, `bQ.qpf`: Quartus project files for synthesis and simulation.
  - `aQ_v.sdo`, `bQ_v.sdo`: Timing simulation files for Quartus.
  - `bQ.bdf`: Block diagram file for visual design in Quartus.
  - `counter5.bsf`: Block symbol file for the 5-bit counter.
  - `shiftreg.bsf`: Block symbol file for a shift register.

- **Documentation:**
  - `report`: A report detailing the design and implementation of the modules.

## Installation

To use the modules and run the testbenches, you will need a Verilog simulator such as ModelSim and Quartus for FPGA design. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the Verilog files and Quartus project files.

3. Open your Verilog simulator and load the modules and their corresponding testbenches.

4. Open Quartus to work with the project files and perform synthesis and simulation.

## Usage

- **Verilog Modules:** Simulate the testbenches using your Verilog simulator to verify functionality.
- **Quartus Projects:** Use Quartus to open the project files, synthesize designs, and perform simulations.
