# Project: Verilog Logic Modules and Testbenches

This project involves the design and implementation of various logic modules using Verilog, along with corresponding testbenches for verification. Each module implements specific logic functions, and the project demonstrates the use of Verilog for hardware description and testing.

## Project Structure

- **Verilog Modules:**
  - `1.v`: Implements a specific logic or function.
  - `2.v`: Implements a specific logic or function.
  - `3.v`: Implements a specific logic or function.

- **Testbenches:**
  - `1TB.v`: Verifies the functionality of the module in `1.v`.
  - `2TB.v`: Verifies the functionality of the module in `2.v`.
  - `3TB.v`: Verifies the functionality of the module in `3.v`.

- **Documentation:**
  - `report`: A report detailing the design and implementation of the modules.

## Installation

To use the modules and run the testbenches, you will need a Verilog simulator such as ModelSim. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the Verilog files and testbenches.

3. Open your Verilog simulator and load the modules and their corresponding testbenches.

## Usage

Each module can be tested using its associated testbench file. The testbenches are designed to verify the functionality of each module. Simulate the testbenches using your Verilog simulator to check the outputs.
