# Project: Verilog Logic Design and Testbenches

This project involves the implementation and testing of various logic designs using Verilog. It includes modules for specific logic operations and circuits, along with testbenches to validate their functionalities. The project is designed to demonstrate the use of Verilog for hardware description and simulation.

## Project Structure

- **Verilog Modules:**
  - `5.v`, `6.v`, `7.v`: Implements specific logic designs.
  - `assign_statement.v`: Module focused on assignment operations.
  - `circuit.v`: Represents a circuit design.
  - `circuitG.v`: Represents a modified or generic version of a circuit.

- **Testbenches:**
  - `assign6testBench.v`: Verifies the functionality of `assign_statement.v`.
  - `testBench.v`: General testbench for various modules.
  - `testBench5.v`: Tests the functionality of `5.v`.
  - `testBench7.v`: Tests the functionality of `7.v`.
  - `testBenchCompare.v`: Compares outputs of different modules.
  - `testBenchG.v`: Tests the functionality of `circuitG.v`.

## Installation

To use the modules and run the testbenches, you will need a Verilog simulator such as ModelSim. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the Verilog files and testbenches.

3. Open your Verilog simulator and load the modules and their corresponding testbenches.

## Usage

Each module can be tested using its associated testbench file. The testbenches are designed to verify the functionality of each module. Simulate the testbenches using your Verilog simulator to check the outputs.
